1. I typed in man man to see the manual page, and read through it to find that the command man -k followed by the keyword to print all the commands that have a specific word.

2. By reading the man page again, I found out that the which command to find the location of mv and sh.

So doing which mv and which sh, I got the locations of mv and sh, which are /usr/local/cs/bin/mv and /usr/bin/sh respectively.

3. By reading the manual page for find, I used the command find /usr/bin -executable -name "?r" to find executables that are 2 characters long, ending with the character r. Then, to know what each executable do, I use the man command. The executables and their functions are:

tr: Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input, writing to standard output.
ar: Creates, modifies and extracts from archives.
pr: Convert text files for printing.

4. I used the commands ls -l /usr/bin/emacs and it outputs:
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 23 Jan  2 15:58 /usr/bin/emacs -> /etc/alternatives/emacs

We can see which file the symbolic link is linking to and hence, the executed file is /etc/alternatives/emacs

5. I used the --version command on /usr/bin/gcc and gcc to get the versions 4.8.5 and 8.2.0 respectively. They're different so that we can create symbolic links to whichever GCC version we want to use.

6. u+sx : sets user ID on execution and gives user permission to execute
o-w : remove write permission for others

7. I used the man page for find to see which commands to use and used the command find /usr/local/cs -type d -ctime -28. Since we're looking only for directories modified in the last four weeks, I used -type d and -ctime 28 (28 because we're looking 4 weeks back).

8. Since find is in the /usr/bin directory, I used the command find /usr/bin -type l | wc -l. The 'l' denotes symbolic link and 'wc' counts the number of lines. I found that there are 280 symbolic links.

9. First I use the command cd /usr/lib64 to change the directory. To sort modification time from newest to oldest, we use -lt and ^. to find the files starting with a '.'.
Then, I used the command ls -lt | grep ^.
I got that the oldest regular file is librom1394.so.0.3.0.

10. I used the command man locale to read through the manual and find that the locale command gets the data based on the settings of the environment variables that control the locale.

11. In Emacs, I used the commands C-h a downcase to get all the Emacs commands with downcase, which are:

downcase-dwim
downcase-region
downcase-word

12. In Emacs, the description of each command can be found using C-h b C-s and going through each command:
C-M-r forward-sexp: Move forward across one balanced expression (sexp).
C-M-s isearch-forward-regexp: Do incremental search forward for regular expression.
C-M-t transpose-sexps: Like C-t ('transpose-chars'), but applies to sexps.
C-M-u backward-up-list: Move backward out of one level of parentheses.
C-M-v scroll-other-window: Scroll next window upward ARG lines; or near full screen if no ARG.

13. In Emacs, I used the commands C-h b C-s C - g to get the full description of C-g:

Signal a 'quit' condition.
During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.

14. According to the Emacs manual, "yanking" means reinserting text previously killed. The keystrokes that is usually used to "yank" is C-y.
C-h b C-s y a n k

15. The commands I ran are:
- On terminal:
cd /usr/bin
ls -l

- On Emacs:
C-x d C-a C-k /usr/bin

And the first difference I noticed, is that the ls -l command says that there is a total of 324576, but the Emacs dired command says that there is a total of 324660 used in directory, which means Emacs displayed 24 more directories. The first difference I saw is that Emacs showed this, while ls -l does not:

  dr-xr-xr-x.   2 root root       77824 Jan  3 13:15 .
  drwxr-xr-x.  15 root root        4096 May 22  2018 ..

I'm sure there are more, but the most obvious difference is this.
