1. In the Linux server, download Coreutils 8.29, its 
signature and its keyring using these commands:
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

Then I ran the shell command specified:
gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

I got this error:
gpg: Signature made Wed Dec 27 10:29:05 2017 PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
gpg: /u/ce/ugrad/arabelle/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: Good signature from "P?draig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
gpg:                 aka "P?draig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
gpg:                 aka "P?draig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.

This error is happening because the key is public and it 
needs to be verified by the user.

2. Untar the tarball using the command:
tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
cd coreutils-8.29

Then use autoreconf to avoid automake missing errors later:
autoreconf -f -i

Make my own temporary directory called temp_dir using the mkdir command:
mkdir temp_dir

Go back to the coreutils-8.29 directory made when we untar the tarball using cd:
cd coreutils-8.29

Looking at the INSTALL file inside the directory, 
it is written that we can install
coreutils using the --prefix flag followed by the directory. 
I used pwd to find the absolute path directory to my 
temporary directory and then use this command to install it:
./configure --prefix=/u/ce/ugrad/arabelle/cs35l_lab3/temp_dir

In the same directory, I run these commands:
make
make install

3. To reproduce the bug, go to /temp_dir/bin using the command:
cd ../temp_dir/bin/

Then, run the command to reproduce the error:
./ls -a -A

As expected, this command ouputs "." and "..", which is the bug we want to fix.

4. Now, to apply the patch, go back to the coreutils-8.29 directory:
cd ../../coreutils-8.29/

Create a new file called patch_file using emacs:
emacs patch_file

Then, I copy and paste the patch provided in Bug#30963 Message#10 to patch_file.
Apply the patch using the patch command, using the -p1 flag to get rid of the 
"a/" or "b/" in the pathname provided by the patch:
patch -p1 < patch_file

5. We want to run the patch using the make command at the 
top level of the coreutils-8.29 directory:
make

Since we're running the make commannd the second time, 
we don't need to run the make install
command again so that we build the patch only on the fixed 
version and not the temporary
directory as well. There were less commands executed 
during this second make call, because
it is only compiling the files related to the patched command.

6. Check that the change fixes the bug in coreutils-8.29 
directory and not in the temp_dir directory.

I. In coreutils-8.29 directory
Use the commands:
cd coreutils-8.29/src
./ls -a -A

The output of the command is: 
.deps              dirname.o                 
 .dirstamp          du                 
'['                 du.c        

We can see that the "." and ".." are not outputted anymore.

II. In temp_dir directory
Use the commands:
cd temp_dir/bin
./ls -a -A

The output of the command is:
.	    chown    dircolors	 groups    md5sum   
 ..	    chroot   dirname	 head	   mkdir    

The "." and ".." are still outputted, so we know that 
this unmodified directory remain unchanged and 
the bug is still present.
