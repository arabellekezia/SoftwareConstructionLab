Q1. I tested the command on the modified and unmodified version of the
directories using the time command: time ls -a -A (on each directory)
I got slightly slower time on the modified version compared to the unmodified
one, even after running it a few times. I think this is because, in the 
modified version, we have an additional code to check and ignore "." and ".."
and this worsens the performance time by a bit.

Q2. This new version of Coreutils should not produce any problems, as long
as the code follows POSIX.1-2008 standards. We also have to be aware for 
cases where we expect "." and ".." to be included as well, in which we put
the -A flag after the -f.

Q3. The script runs into an error when running it with an empty file with
line numbers more than 0 (because the default numlines is 1).
Since numlines is more than 0, it will be passed to the chooseline()
function what passes the file to random.choice(). But since the 
file is empty, the random.choice() function will output an IndexError
saying that list index is out of range:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.15/lib/python2.7/random.py", 
	line 277, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  
	# raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

Q4. When running the script in Python3, it outputs a SyntaxError. 
This is because Python3 depreceated 'automatic tuple unpacking',
which unable us to pass (errno, sterror) as an exception.

This is the error message I got when running it with Python2:

  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
